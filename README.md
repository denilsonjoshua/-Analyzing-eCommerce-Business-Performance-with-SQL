# -Analyzing-eCommerce-Business-Performance-with-SQL
In this mini project, I played the role of a Data Analytics in an Ecommerce company. As a Data Analytics, I was tasked with analyzing three aspects related to the company's business performance. These aspects include customer growth, product quality, and payment methods. I started by conducting data preparation before moving on to the next stage, which is the analysis of business performance. From the business performance analysis I conducted, I found that the most preferred payment method is credit card. There was a significant increase in the use of debit cards from 2017 to 2018, and the increase in debit card usage may be due to promotions or collaborations with specific debit card providers. Additionally, there was a reduction in the use of vouchers as a promotional method.
